                2. Pranayama (Breathing Techniques): Techniques for controlling and enhancing the breath, which is considered vital for overall health and effective yoga practice.<br>

                6. Practicum: Hands-on teaching practice under supervision to build confidence and competence in instructing yoga classes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Benefits of Yoga Certification<br>
                    1. Credibility: A yoga certificate provides credibility and demonstrates that the instructor has received formal training and adheres to professional standards.<br>

                    4. Community and Networking: Yoga teacher training programs create a community of like-minded individuals, providing support and networking opportunities.</p><br>
                    <p>Continuing Education<br>
                        Certified yoga teachers are encouraged to continue their education through workshops, additional certifications, and advanced training. This not only enhances their skills and knowledge but also keeps them updated with the latest developments in the field of yoga.</p><br>
